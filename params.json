{"name":"Short Circuit","tagline":"Cross-platform tower defense game written in Java/jMonkeyEngine 3.0","body":"ShortCircuit is a tower defense game written in Java/jMonkeyEngine 3. It is the result of a lot of independent work, as well as an independent study with professor Matthew Whitehead at The Colorado College. It is designed to be played on an Android tablet, and features some interesting Computer Science techniques that I have learned.\r\n>![Screenshot](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/scp1.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe game features A* pathfinding, which I implemented without the use of help from the engine. The pathfinding uses threading, and allows for many different units pathfinding around user-placed barriers. The pathfinding had to be efficient enough to allow for a numerous amount of enemies to be able to spawn on an Android device. Below, you can see an example of many enemies all pathfinding to the user's base.\r\n>![Screenshot](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/scp2.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe game also features sound design elements that were heavily influenced by the musical experiences I've had at The Colorado College.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the game is still in development. It will be released on the Google Play Store as soon as I have enough time to dedicate to getting the game to where I would like it to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nÂ© Connor Rice, 2015\r\n\r\n[View the rest of my projects](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
